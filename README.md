## Available Scripts in detail

* npm start
* Webpack parses through the app starting at src/index.js, following any imported modules, until it has a complete dependency graph which then will be used to create a single JS file consisting of the app source code and modules used by the app, injects the file via script tag into public/index.html, and starts a development server on <http://localhost:3000>
* npm test
* * Jest testing framework handles unit testing here and it starts the test runner in 'watch' mode
* npm build
* * Webpack creates an optimized, production-ready bundle of the app, generates a new folder & files (./build/). The bundle created from this configuration has the source code minified and compressed for performance benefits and it also generates source maps
* npm eject
* * calling this command will remove the settings and all the nice stuff create-react-app provides for you
